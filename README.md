Submitted by: Rabindra Yadav

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [Done] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [Done] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [Done] UI animations
* [Done] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

## Notes

It was the first time I built an IOS application. It was very fun to see everything working together.
I had a typo in the project and took some time to notice that. Other than it was a smooth process.
